    "Recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, are widely used in a variety of mediums. RNNs leverage sequential data to make predictions. Sequential memory makes it easier for the neural network to recognize patterns and replicate the input. In order to achieve learning through sequential memory, a feedforward neural network with looping mechanisms is implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the image below outlines, there are three layers: input, hidden and output. There are loops that pass previous information forward, allowing the model to sequentially store and learn the data. The complexity of a hidden state is based on how much “historic” information is being stored, it is a representation of all previous steps. When training a model, once there is a prediction from a given output, a loss function is used to determine the error between the predicted output and real output. The model is trained through back propagation. The weight of each node in the neural network is adjusted with their corresponding gradient that is calculated during back propagation. \n",
