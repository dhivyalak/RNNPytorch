    "*<strong>Recurrent neural networks</strong>*, or RNNs, are widely used in a variety of mediums. RNNs leverage sequential data to make predictions. **Sequential memory** makes it easier for the neural network to recognize patterns and replicate the input. In order to achieve learning through sequential memory, a **feedforward neural network** with looping mechanisms is implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the image below outlines, there are *three* layers: **input, hidden and output**. There are loops that pass previous information forward, allowing the model to *sequentially* store and learn the data. The complexity of a hidden state is based on how much “historic” information is being stored, it is a representation of all previous steps. When training a model, once there is a prediction from a given output, a **loss function** is used to determine the error between the predicted output and real output. The model is trained through back propagation. The weight of each node in the neural network is adjusted with their corresponding gradient that is calculated during **back propagation**. \n",

    "Prior to training a model, it is important to understand the type of data you are working with. There are many different types of data, this notebook incorporates time series data. In essence, time series data is a collection of chronologically collected observations made over a period of time- sometimes during specific intervals. Time series data can be grouped as either *<strong>metrics</strong>* or *<strong>events</strong>*. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Metrics**: measurements taken at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Events**: measurements taken at irregular intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing if the data is comprised of metrics or events is critical. Events are not condusive for creating predictive models. The irregular intervals between each data point prevents sequential logic from creating patterns on past behavior. In contrast, the characteristic regularity between each metric allows machine learing models to learn from previous data and construct possible outcomes for the future. Creating an RNN using time series data, specifically metrics, is a great way to take advantage of the sequential learning pattern they leverage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, time series data can also be categorized as *<strong>linear</strong>* or *<strong>non-linear</strong>*. Based on the mathematical relationship created by the model, the data is classified as one or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular examples of time series data include weather, stock, and health care data. In this notebook, we will be using stock data to create an RNN model to predict the value of the given stock. \n",
